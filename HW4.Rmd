### 1. Consider the spatial data set from Olea (2006).
```{r}
library(geoR)
data = readxl::read_xlsx("data.xlsx")[,-1]
names(data)=c("x","y","z")
```


#### (a) Based on the data analysis you did in homework 3 (or a new one), entertain three or four tentative models, with different mean and/or semivariogram functions, and choose the ‘best model’ using BIC.

```{r}
# The first model, we assume that the mean function is constant. 
data.mean1 = as.geodata(data)
breaks = seq(0,32)

```
